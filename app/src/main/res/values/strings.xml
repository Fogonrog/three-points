    <string name="greetings">Hello, welcome to the Three Points game!
In this game your job is to connect two shores using mathematical functions.</string>
    <string name="first_help">     1. To add a function, tap the plus button located at the bottom of your screen. This will bring up Math Operation buttons and the current function value.</string>
    <string name="second_help">     2. Then, select an operation you want to perform on the current function and it will immediately display a shrunken version of the functions graph.</string>
    <string name="third_help">     3. Experiment! Try out different mathematical operations to get interesting solutions.</string>
    <string name="fourth_help">     4. When youre satisfied with your function, you can tap the "Done" button and your new function will display on the main graph.</string>
    <string name="fifth_help">     5. When youre finished with your task, tap the triangle button located at the top of your screen to check your solution. It will launch a train running through your function.</string>
    <string name="sixth_help">     6. At higher levels of the game, you may encounter empty figures, which are contour objects for which the function must pass. </string>
    <string name="seventh_help">     7. At the same time along the path to building of the function which may encounter obstacles - filled figures, which the function should not cross. Pay attention and take these objects into account in order to properly build a function and connect the two riverbanks.</string>
    <string name="parting">We hope these tips will help you in passing the game. Study functions, experiment and build a bridge across the shores! Good luck!</string>
